## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
Fonts: Playfair Display (Serif), Lato (Sans-serif)
Deployment:  

## 🎨 Design Choices
1.  Color Palette: I chose `#D4AF37` (Gold) for accents to signify luxury, paired with `#3B2F2F` (Umber) to represent the deep, rich tones of brewed tea.
2.  Typography: Used *Playfair Display* for headings to provide a "Royal" heritage feel, while using *Lato* for body text to maintain modern readability.
3.  Minimalism: The layout is intentionally spacious to keep the focus on the product's premium nature and the primary "Notify Me" goal.
